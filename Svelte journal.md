Svelt journal:

Svelte is extremely fast! I know that some framework have the called "live-reload", that is the feature where you modify the code and soon the changes will be reflected in the development server. Svelte has the same... or I would call it "live-reloaded" as it is faster than blinking your eyes hahahah.
Of course, great part of this power comes from the fact that it uses non-transpiled code and pure Javascript.

Another point that is interting to notice is that Svelte components arrange seens to be pretty natural to me. It's very close to web components. The idea is to declare your component, it's style inside and it's business logic in the same file with `.svelte` type. (kind of HTML + CSS + JS)
